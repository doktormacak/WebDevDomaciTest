        I still believe in your eyes
        I just don't care what you have done in your life
        Baby, I'll always be here by your side
        Don't leave me waiting too long,
        Please come by

        I, I, I, I still believe in your eyes
        There is no choice, I belong to your life
        Because I will live to love you someday
        You'll be my baby and we'll fly away
        And I'll fly with you, I'll fly with you,
        I'll fly with you
        
        You are, are, are, are, are, are
        You are, are, are, are, are, are
        You are, are, are, are, are, are

        Every day and every night
        I always dream that you are by my side
        Oh baby, every day and every night
        Well, I said everything's gonna be alright
        And I'll fly with you, I'll fly with you,
        I'll fly with you

        You are, are, are, are, are, are
        You are, are, are, are, are, are

        Dream of me, I still believe in your eyes
        I just don't care what you've done in your life

        Last Christmas I gave you my heart
        But the very next day you gave it away
        This year, to save me from tears
        I'll give it to someone special

        Last Christmas I gave you my heart
        But the very next day you gave it away (you gave it away)
        This year, to save me from tears
        I'll give it to someone special (special)

        Once bitten and twice shy
        I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
        Tell me baby, do you recognize me?
        Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

        "Merry Christmas" I wrapped it up and sent it
        With a note saying "I love you", I meant it
        Now I know what a fool I've been
        But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

        Last Christmas I gave you my heart
        But the very next day you gave it away (you gave it away)
        This year, to save me from tears
        I'll give it to someone special (special)

        Ohh
        Oh, oh, baby

        A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
        I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
        My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
        Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

        A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
        A man under cover but you tore me apart
        Ooh, ooh, now I've found a real love
        You'll never fool me again

        Maybe next year we'll give it to someone
        I'll give it to someone special
        Special
        So long...
